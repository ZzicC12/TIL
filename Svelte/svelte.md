# Svelte

## Reactivity

- At the heart of Svelte is a powerful system of reactivity for keeping the DOM in sync with your application state.
- Svelte automatically updates the DOM when your component's state changes.
- Reactive values become particularly valuable when you need to reference them multiple times, or you have values that depend on other reactive values.
- Svelte's reactivity is triggered by assignments.

## Props

## Logic

- A # character always indicates a block opening tag. A / character always indicates a block closing tag. A : character, as in {:else}, indicates a block continuation tag.
